# Tree-name
Well, this is a coconut tree. Just kidding, but i'm willing to name it coconut.

# rosy-extended-trees
AOSP Trees for rosy, not really clean, merged from sukrut4778's trees.

# What is this
This is, well, obviously, a tree.
Based on ExtendedUI (AOSP). Makes building AOSP Roms (well, a bit) easier.

Mostly, big thanks to sukrut4778 for the trees.
